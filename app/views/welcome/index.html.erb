  <h1> Current Work </h1>

  <h2> GovWizely </h2>
  <p> 
    Since September 2014, I have been working on open data search APIs and search apps for <a href="http://www.govwizely.com/">GovWizely</a>, 
    a contractor in Washington DC servicing primarily the Department of Commerce (DoC) and 
    General Services Administration (GSA).
  </p>
  <p>
    My work has mostly focused on contributing to the Internation Trade Administration (ITA)'s open data API, 
    <a href="https://api.trade.gov/">api.trade.gov</a>. 

    You can find out more information about this service, as well as documentation, here: 
    <a href="https://developer.trade.gov/">developer.trade.gov</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since July of 2016, I have been focused on developing report-building front end apps that leverage our 
    endpoint-me feature, a tool on <a href="https://api.trade.gov/">api.trade.gov</a>
    that allows users to build their own JSON search endpoints in Elasicsearch with only a simple configuration file.
  </p>

  <h2> Bandy's Bakery </h2>
  <p> 
    <a href="http://bandysbakery.com/">Bandy's Bakery</a>
     is a work-in-progress side project I took on for a friend as an excercise in building a full-stack, 
     full-featured ecommerce site in Rails.
  </p>

  <h1>Looking Ahead</h1>
  <p> 
    I am not currently looking for a new full time job, but am always interested in side projects. Particularly if it is something related to machine learning, AI, and 
    natural language processing, and would not take more than 10-15 hours a week.
